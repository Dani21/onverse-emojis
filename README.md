# About This Repository
This is a remake of the emoticons from Onverse, with the recreated versions hereby called emojis. The goal is to make high quality SVG emojis that are open-source, as similar as possible to the original emoticons, and in some ways diverge from the originals to improve them. There will not be an attempt to improve on an emoticon if the change would also affect the emotion protrayed, however new emojis are not out of the question.

# What is an SVG?
An SVG is a scalable vector graphic, which means that it can be resized to any screen size without losing detail. That said, more detail is not created at larger sizes; the details built in would just become more visible. In addition SVGs are actually just text files describing an image. You can open them up with an editor, but you will need a program like Inkscape or a web browser to view what it looks like.

# How do I download these emojis?
If you just want to view these, you can click on any file in the repository and they will show up. However if you want to download image versions of these, go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/Dani21/onverse-emojis/releases/latest) and download any or all of the emojis you want. Another way to do it would be to find the 'Tags' link at the top of the page, and either clicking a link for a specific version or visiting the releases tab from there.
